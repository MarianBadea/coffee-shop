                    <p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, with over 400 billion cups served annually. In the United States alone, about 450 million cups of coffee are consumed every day. It is estimated that about 107 million people in the country drink coffee every day. The beverage is brewed from coffee beans obtained from a plant species known as coffee. This plant species is native to tropical Africa, having originated from Sudan and Ethiopia. Today, the coffee plant is cultivated in over 70 countries across the globe with Brazil as the largest producer followed by Vietnam and Colombia. There are two types of coffee: Arabica and Robusta.

                    <h2>Origin Of The Name</h2>
                    <p>The name coffee may have resulted from Keffa Zone, the name of the area where coffee berries were first used by herders either in the 6th or 9th century. Keffa Zone is a region in southwestern Ethiopia. The name “coffee” was included in the language in 1582 through the Dutch word “koffie.” The phrase “coffee pot” was introduced in 1705 while “coffee break” was introduced in 1953.</p>
